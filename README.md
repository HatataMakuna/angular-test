# AngularTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.

## Development server
1. Run `json-server --watch db.json` to start the JSON database server. This will generate a db.json file if you don't have the file yet. (Remember to run `npm install json-server` if you haven't install the json-server package)
2. Leave the JSON server terminal running. Now open another terminal and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
